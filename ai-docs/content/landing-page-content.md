## Section 3: Problem Statement

### H2
```
Frontend Generation Gives You Momentum
```

### Lead Paragraph
```
Tools like Lovable, Bolt.new, and Replit excel at rapid frontend generation—but momentum alone doesn't build production applications. The backend primitives your app needs don't generate themselves.
```

### Pain Points

**Pain Point 1:**
```
Icon: Database
Text: Persistent state infrastructure
Subtext: AI agents lose conversation context, e-commerce carts disappear, SaaS dashboards can't retain user preferences
```

**Pain Point 2:**
```
Icon: GitBranch
Text: Workflow orchestration primitives
Subtext: Multi-step processes can't be managed—no task queues, no async handlers, no distributed coordination
```

**Pain Point 3:**
```
Icon: ShieldAlert
Text: Production guardrails and resilience
Subtext: No rate limiting, no circuit breakers, no failure isolation—one error cascades through your entire system
```

**Pain Point 4:**
```
Icon: Server
Text: Scalable backend architecture
Subtext: Generated scaffolds are monoliths—no service separation, no independent scaling, no distributed primitives
```

### Closing Statement
```
Frontend generation gives you momentum. But infrastructure is what sustains it.
```

### Flow Diagram

**Concept Description:**
A three-stage horizontal flow diagram illustrating the frontend-to-infrastructure gap. Stage 1 (left) shows rapid frontend generation with a success indicator.

Unlike traditional Backend-as-a-Service platforms that provide building blocks for manual assembly, AutoRail performs automatic infrastructure provisioning based on code analysis. The platform identifies your application's infrastructure needs and provisions appropriate backend primitives—databases, orchestration systems, API gateways, circuit breakers, monitoring, and auto-scaling—without requiring manual configuration or infrastructure expertise.
```

### Capability Summary
```
AutoRail provisions backend primitives automatically: state management infrastructure with Redis and PostgreSQL backing, workflow orchestration using Temporal for async operations, API gateway with rate limiting and authentication, circuit breaker layer for failure isolation, distributed observability with OpenTelemetry tracing, and auto-scale controller for load-based resource adjustment—all configured and managed without manual intervention.
```

### Process Summary
```
AutoRail provisions infrastructure in six steps: connect your application codebase from any tool, analyze code to identify backend primitive needs, provision required infrastructure components automatically, configure service architecture with proper communication patterns, deploy with built-in observability and monitoring, and continuously adapt infrastructure as your code evolves—maintaining momentum with sustained infrastructure support.
```

### Architecture Statement
```
AutoRail provisions production-grade backend primitives automatically: isolated services for separation of concerns, independent scaling infrastructure for each component, circuit breakers for failure containment, distributed tracing for observability, API gateway for request management, and managed service coordination—transforming monolithic applications into distributed systems with proper infrastructure patterns.
```

### Target Audience Statement
```
AutoRail serves indie hackers shipping AI agents without backend expertise, startup teams scaling SaaS platforms without DevOps engineers, e-commerce builders needing transactional infrastructure, and developers building internal dashboards who want infrastructure provisioned automatically—anyone creating vibe-coded applications that need production-grade backend primitives.
