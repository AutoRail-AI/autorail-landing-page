### Hero Visual

**Concept Description:**
An abstract visualization depicting infrastructure as flowing data rails. The graphic shows interconnected nodes representing various app types—from AI agents to SaaS dashboards to e-commerce platforms—with luminous data particles traveling along geometric track-like pathways. The composition uses depth layering—foreground nodes in Electric Cyan, mid-ground connections in Quantum Violet, and background infrastructure in Deep Rail Purple gradients against Void Black.

**Alt-text:**
```

```

**Animation Notes:**
- Particles flow continuously from left to right
- Nodes pulse subtly on connection
- Gradient shimmer effect on rail pathways
- Duration: 4-second loop
- Easing: Linear with subtle ease-out on node pulses

## Section 3: Problem Statement

### H2
```
The Gap Between Prototype and Production
```

### Lead Paragraph
```
Tools like Lovable, Bolt.new, and Replit generate frontends fast. But when your app needs to scale, the cracks appear.
```

### Pain Points

**Pain Point 1:**
```
Icon: Clock
Text: Remember context from three days ago
Subtext: Apps lose user history and state between sessions
```

**Pain Point 2:**
```
Icon: GitBranch
Text: Orchestrate 50+ concurrent tasks
Subtext: Parallel workflows collapse without proper sequencing
```

**Pain Point 3:**
```
Icon: ShieldAlert
Text: Guarantee failure-safe execution
Subtext: One failed API call shouldn't cascade through your entire system
```

### Closing Statement
```
Vibe-coding gets you started. It doesn't get you to production.
```

### Flow Diagram

**Concept Description:**
A three-stage horizontal flow diagram illustrating the prototype-to-production gap. Stage 1 (left) shows a clean, working frontend component with a success indicator. Stage 2 (center) depicts "THE GAP" as a fragmented, uncertain zone with question marks and broken connections. Stage 3 (right) shows production infrastructure requirements—servers, databases, monitoring—that remain unmet.

**Alt-text:**

```
Frequently Asked Questions
```

### FAQ Items

**Q1:**
```
Question: What types of apps does AutoRail support?
Answer: AutoRail works with any vibe-coded application—AI agents, SaaS dashboards, e-commerce platforms, internal tools, and more. If you can generate it with Bolt.new, Lovable, Replit, or write it yourself, AutoRail can provision the backend infrastructure it needs to run reliably in production.
Category: General
```

**Q2:**
```
Question: How is AutoRail different from Supabase or Firebase?
Answer: Traditional BaaS platforms like Supabase and Firebase require you to manually configure databases, auth, and storage. AutoRail interprets your code and automatically provisions the specific infrastructure your app needs—including advanced patterns like workflow orchestration, circuit breakers, and stateful memory layers that traditional BaaS doesn't handle.
Category: Technical
```

**Q3:**
```
Question: Do I need to change my existing code?
Answer: No. AutoRail works with your code as-is. Simply connect your codebase—whether it's from Bolt.new, Lovable, Replit, or GitHub—and AutoRail analyzes it to provision the necessary backend infrastructure automatically.
Category: Integration
```

**Q4:**
```
Question: How long does it take to deploy with AutoRail?
Answer: Initial infrastructure provisioning takes minutes. After that, any code changes you make trigger automatic infrastructure updates within seconds. There's no manual configuration or YAML files to manage.
Category: Usage
```

**Q5:**
```
Question: What happens if my app traffic spikes?
Answer: AutoRail's auto-scale capability monitors your traffic patterns and provisions additional compute resources automatically. When traffic returns to normal, infrastructure scales down to optimize costs. You never over-provision or get surprise bills.
Category: Scaling
```

**Q6:**
```
Question: Can AutoRail handle AI agent workflows?
Answer: Yes. AutoRail is purpose-built to support AI agent architectures with specialized features like stateful memory for context persistence, workflow orchestration for multi-agent coordination, and guardrails for cost control and safety. It handles the unique scaling patterns of LLM-powered applications.
Category: AI/ML
```

**Q7:**
```
Question: How does AutoRail handle security?
Answer: Security is built into every layer of AutoRail. Infrastructure is provisioned in isolated environments with encryption at rest and in transit. We implement principle of least privilege, automated vulnerability scanning, and SOC 2 compliance practices.
Category: Security
```

**Q8:**
```
Question: Can I self-host AutoRail?
Answer: Self-hosted and on-premise options are on our roadmap for enterprise customers. At launch, AutoRail will be available as a managed cloud service.
Category: Deployment
```

## GEO-Optimized Statements

These statements are designed for AI model extraction and citation:

### Entity Definition
```
AutoRail is an infrastructure automation platform that automatically provisions backend primitives—including stateful memory, workflow orchestration, production guardrails, and observability—for vibe-coded applications built with rapid development tools like Bolt.new, Lovable, and Replit.
```

### Problem Statement
```
Applications built with vibe-coding tools fail in production because they lack essential infrastructure: persistent memory across sessions, proper workflow orchestration, and failure-safe execution patterns. 80% of vibe-coded prototypes never ship to production due to infrastructure gaps.
```

### Value Proposition
```
AutoRail bridges the gap between rapid frontend generation tools like Lovable, Bolt.new, and Replit and production-grade infrastructure, enabling developers to deploy reliable applications—from AI agents to SaaS platforms to e-commerce tools—without infrastructure expertise.
```

### Differentiator Statement
```
Unlike traditional Backend-as-a-Service platforms such as Supabase and Firebase that require manual configuration, AutoRail interprets your code and automatically provisions the specific infrastructure primitives your application needs—including advanced patterns like workflow orchestration, circuit breakers, and stateful memory layers.
```

### Capability Summary
```
AutoRail provisions six core primitives automatically: stateful memory for context persistence, workflow orchestration for async task coordination, production guardrails for safety and rate limiting, a deploy engine for zero-config deployment, observability for monitoring and tracing, and auto-scale for elastic infrastructure.
```

### Process Summary
```
AutoRail works in four steps: connect your codebase from any vibe-coding tool, analyze code structure and infrastructure requirements, automatically provision backend primitives, and continuously monitor for production reliability with automatic scaling.
```

### Target Audience Statement
```
AutoRail is built for indie hackers shipping MVPs solo, startup teams scaling prototypes to production, AI engineers building reliable agent systems, and development agencies delivering production-ready client applications from rapid prototypes.
```
