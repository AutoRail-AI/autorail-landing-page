## What is autorail?

autorail is a governance infrastructure platform for AI-powered development that ensures AI-generated code meets production standards. It consists of two products: unerr, a hosted MCP server that injects your actual architecture into your AI agent's context window, and necroma, an autonomous legacy migration engine that uses behavioral verification.

## Product: unerr

unerr is a hosted MCP server — the missing backend for AI coding agents. It connects to your repo (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or even a local directory) and injects your actual architecture, conventions, and blast radius into your AI agent's context window. One command. Zero workflow changes. Works with Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, Windsurf, and Devin.

### unerr Features
- Blast Radius Visualization — traverses the call graph N hops outward to every API boundary and UI component
- Spaghetti Shield — automated PR review: Semgrep rules → knowledge graph impact analysis → line-level review comments
- Rewind & Circuit Breaker — one click restores to last known-good state, auto-generates anti-pattern rules
- Drift Detection — computes semantic drift when files change, fires Drift Alerts automatically
- Auto-Generated ADRs — auto-generates and commits Architecture Decision Records as follow-up PRs

### How unerr works (4 layers)
1. Blueprint — indexes your repo into a living knowledge graph
2. Real-Time Sync — webhooks detect changes, re-indexes in 30 seconds
3. Rewind — timeline scrubber to restore last known-good state, circuit breaker halts hallucination loops
4. Constitution — enforces guardrails on every AI-generated change

### Supported AI Coding Agents
- Cursor
- Claude Code
- Copilot
- Windsurf
- Devin
- Any MCP-compatible agent

## Product: necroma

necroma is an autonomous legacy migration tool that records DOM events, network calls, and user flows from live applications, generates Playwright tests from observed behavior, then forces AI to rewrite legacy code module-by-module until every behavioral test passes. It delivers modernized, production-ready features in days instead of quarters.

### necroma Features
- Behavioral recording — captures DOM events, network calls, and user flows
- Test generation — creates Playwright tests from observed behavior
- AI-driven rewriting — forces modern code until all tests pass
- Vertical slice delivery — ship modernized features incrementally, not Big Bang rewrites
- Self-healing guardrails — automatically fixes code when tests fail

## Category: AI Code Governance

AI code governance refers to the tools and practices that make AI-assisted development production-safe at scale. While AI coding tools dramatically accelerate code generation, they require supervision infrastructure — blast radius analysis, drift detection, automated code review, and regression prevention — to produce maintainable, enterprise-grade code. autorail's unerr is a purpose-built tool in this category, operating natively on the MCP channel.

## Security
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256)
- Single-tenant data isolation
- No model training on customer code
- 24-hour data deletion on disconnect
